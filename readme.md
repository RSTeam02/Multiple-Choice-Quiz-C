progress:


28.12. controller.c:
+ 30.12. input validation consists of:<br /> 
    => letter checking: if user enters char(s) that don't consist in the set of solutions (e.g. AXCB in ABCD), repeat user input<br />
    => check Answer: convert to upper case, sort string, remove duplicates, when user enters e.g. ccaabba will be ABC

+ 29.12. fixed score bug (char arr termination)
+ 28.12. create player with name, score, print question, user input, check answer, sum score (buggy)
+ 28.12. input validation: check user input


26.12. shuffle.c:

+ shuffle positions of answers and solutions 

26.12. structs:

+ player type struct: name and score
+ strStruct type struct: char array with number of row information
+ qStruct type struct => single question as char array with question size and row information 

24.12. filereader.c:

+ step1: store the whole text in a char array, count number of lines

24.12. question.c:

+ step2: delimit the whole string by row "\n" (set of questions)
+ step3: store all questions in a 2-dim qStruct array, then delimit every column of a row by "," (question, answer and solution possibilities) 
+ print question, answer, solution of right answer(s) in letters (A-Z)
